# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis Project
## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by subscription-based businesses. This project presents an end-to-end churn analysis case study using customer behavior, usage patterns, subscription information, and engagement signals to predict customer churn and derive actionable business insights.

The project covers the full data science workflow — from problem framing and data cleaning to model evaluation and business recommendations — demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn occurs when customers discontinue using a company’s product or service. High churn rates directly impact revenue, customer lifetime value, and long-term business growth.

## Objectives of this project:

Understand customer churn behavior

Identify key drivers of churn

Build predictive models to detect at-risk customers

Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

Customer demographics

Usage and activity patterns

Subscription and tenure information

Engagement-related features

A churn indicator (target variable)

This dataset is well-suited for classification-based churn modeling and business analysis.

##5️⃣ Postdictive Analysis

Predicted churn outcomes were compared against actual churn to assess model performance.

Findings:

The model performed well at identifying customers with gradual churn patterns

False positives occurred due to temporary drops in engagement

Some sudden churn cases were missed due to lack of behavioral warning signals

This analysis highlighted both the strengths and limitations of the model in a real business setting.

## 📈 Results Summary

Balanced classification performance across churn and non-churn classes

Strong recall for churned customers

Practical insights into customer behavior patterns

Clear pathways for improving retention strategies

##🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

##🚀 Future Improvements

Incorporate time-series features for behavior trends

Try advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Add customer support and pricing data

Deploy the model via an API or dashboard
